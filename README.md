<h1>"Revolutionary Task Management App ðŸš€"</h1>

Are you tired of the same old boring, functional, and actually useful to-do apps? Well, you're in luck! Introducing *yet another to-do app*, painstakingly crafted with React. Because, honestly, the world desperately needed one more.

### Features:
- **Add Tasks**: Finally, the groundbreaking ability to add tasks. Truly life-changing.  
- **Delete Tasks**: Why keep a task when you can delete it and feel productive without actually doing anything?  
- **Mark as Complete**: A satisfying strike-through to remind you of your fleeting accomplishments.  

### Technology Stack:
- **React**: Because why use vanilla JavaScript when you can overcomplicate things?  
- **CSS**: Minimal effort for maximum mediocrity.  

### Why use this app?
Honestly, thereâ€™s no reason. It does exactly what the other million to-do apps do, just with my name attached to it. But hey, it works... sometimes.

Contributions are welcome if you're into fixing problems I may or may not have caused. Star this repo if you want to support the endless cycle of recreating to-do apps for no apparent reason. âœ¨
